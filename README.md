# SnakeCoin

A minimal BlockChain implementation in PHP

In an [article on dev.to](https://dev.to/aunyks/lets-build-the-tiniest-blockchain), Gerald Nash showed a simple blockchain implementation in less than 50 lines of Python 2 code, which he called SnakeCoin.

This is a port of the code from that article to PHP.

## Try It!

To run the demo, just type

    $ php snakecoin.php

The output will be similar to

    Block #1 has been added to the blockchain!

## Hashing

In this implementation, the `hash()` function is used
with the `SHA256` algorithm
